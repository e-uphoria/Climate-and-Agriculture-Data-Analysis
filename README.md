# Climate and Agriculture Data Analysis of Nepal

> *This project was carried out under the guidance of Mr. Ravi Bhattarai.*

This project presents a detailed data analysis of climate and agriculture in Nepal using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal was to extract patterns, visualize changes, and understand the relationships between temperature, rainfall, and agricultural productivity.

## Project Overview

The project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on national-level climate and agriculture datasets
- District-level deep dive into **Kailali**
- Region-based analysis for:
  - **Terai Region only**
  - **Middle Hills Region only**
  - **First Quarter (Jan–Mar) of the year**
- Merging of **Terai-specific climate data** with **agriculture data** for comparative insight

## Project Structure

- `analysis/dataanalysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with step-by-step code and visualizations
- `infographic poster/POSTER.pdf`: Infographic summarizing findings in a visual format
- `raw data/agriculture.csv`: Agriculture data sourced from Tableau Public
- `raw data/dailyclimate.csv`: Climate data sourced from Kaggle
- `shapefile/shapefiles/`: Shapefiles of Nepal's districts for geospatial visualizations 

## Levels of Analysis Performed

- Entire country of **Nepal**
- Specific focus on **Kailali district**
- **Terai Region** and **Middle Hills Region** comparison
- Seasonal insight: **First Quarter (Jan–Mar)**
- **Climate–Agriculture merged dataset** analysis for Terai region

## Data Sources

- **Climate Data**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/saimondahal/nepal-climate-data-eda-insights/input)
- **Agriculture Data**: [Tableau Public] (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sadichchha1369/viz/NepaCropMapwithprovinceSAMPLE_15636442141840/Dashboard1)
